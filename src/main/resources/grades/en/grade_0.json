      "description": "<p>Clean Code Developer (CCD) grow step by step in a system of grades. Real work starts in red grade. But what if someone is interested in Clean Code Development and does not yet know how to start? What if he or she is motivated but bureaucratic hurdles are in the way.</p><p>To signalize that you are interested in clean code development there is the black grade. In this grade you were a black bracelet to indicate your readiness to become a CCD. There is not yet daily reflection involved concerning the CCD values.</p><p>Hence black bracelets can be distributed without limitation. They simply indicate that you are interest in getting prepared for working on the read grade. They are viral advertisers for clean code development.</p>",
